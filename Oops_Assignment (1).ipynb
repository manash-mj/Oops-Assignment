        "1.   What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing code that uses:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Objects: Like real-life things (e.g., cars, users).\n",
        "2. Classes: Blueprints for creating objects.\n",
        "3. Properties: Characteristics of objects (e.g., color, name).\n",
        "4. Methods: Actions objects can perform (e.g., drive, login).\n",
        "\n",
        "It helps organize code, make it reusable, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2.   What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties and behaviors of an object. It's a collection of:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Attributes (data): Characteristics of the object (e.g., name, age).\n",
        "2. Methods (functions): Actions the object can perform (e.g., walk, talk).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3.   What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> An object is an instance of a class, representing a real-world entity or concept. It has:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Properties (attributes): Data that describes the object (e.g., name, color).\n",
        "2. Behaviors (methods): Actions the object can perform (e.g., walk, calculate).\n",
        "\n",
        "Characteristics\n",
        "1. Unique identity: Each object has its own set of attributes and state.\n",
        "2. State: The current values of an object's attributes.\n",
        "3. Behavior: The actions an object can perform.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4.   What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  Abstraction\n",
        "- Hiding complexity: Showing only essential features, hiding implementation details.\n",
        "- Focus on interface: Defining what an object can do, without specifying how.\n",
        "- Example: A car's accelerator pedal abstracts the complex engine mechanics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation\n",
        "- Hiding data: Bundling data with methods that operate on it, controlling access.\n",
        "- Protecting internal state: Preventing direct access to an object's internal data.\n",
        "- Example: A bank account encapsulates balance data, allowing access only through deposit/withdrawal methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5.   What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  Dunder stands for \"double underscore.\" Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, are surrounded by double underscores (__) and are used for:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Operator overloading: Customizing behavior for operators like +, -, *, etc.\n",
        "2. Special operations: Defining behavior for operations like initialization, representation, and comparison.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6.   Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (the subclass or derived class) inherits the properties and behavior of an existing class (the superclass or base class).\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Benefits\n",
        "1. Code Reusability: Subclasses inherit common attributes and methods from the superclass.\n",
        "2. Hierarchical Relationships: Subclasses can specialize or extend the behavior of the superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7.   What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms, depending on the context. This allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8.   How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  Encapsulation means hiding an object's internal details and controlling access to its data.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it's achieved:\n",
        "1. Private variables: Using double underscore (__) to make variables harder to access directly.\n",
        "2. Getter and setter methods: Using @property to control access to data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits\n",
        "1. Protects data: Keeps internal state safe.\n",
        "2. Improves code: Makes code more organized and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9.   What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  A constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created. In Python, the constructor method is defined using __init__.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose\n",
        "The constructor is used to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Initialize attributes: Set initial values for an object's properties.\n",
        "2. Set up object state: Perform any necessary setup or initialization.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  Class Methods\n",
        "- Belong to the class: Can be called without creating an instance.\n",
        "- *Use @classmethod*: Define a method that works with the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Static Methods\n",
        "- Just a function inside a class: Doesn't use class or instance data.\n",
        "- *Use @staticmethod*: Define a method that's independent.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11.  What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  Method overloading is when multiple methods with the same name can be defined, but with different parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python's Approach\n",
        "Python doesn't support traditional method overloading like some other languages. Instead, you can use:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Default argument values: Provide default values for some parameters.\n",
        "2. Variable arguments: Use *args or **kwargs to handle variable numbers of arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  Method overriding is when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose\n",
        "- Customize behavior: The subclass can tailor the method to its specific needs.\n",
        "- Polymorphism: Objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  The @property decorator allows you to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1 . Customize attribute access: Control how attributes are accessed and modified.\n",
        "2 . Implement getters and setters: Define methods that are called when an attribute is accessed or modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  Polymorphism is important because it:\n",
        "\n",
        "1 . Increases flexibility: Allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "2 . Promotes code reusability: Code can work with a variety of data types and objects.\n",
        "3 . Enhances modularity: Makes it easier to add new functionality without modifying existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15.  What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  In Python, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to be a base class for other classes. It defines a common interface for all its subclasses and may contain abstract methods that must be implemented in any subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "16.  What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  Advantages of OOP\n",
        "1 . Modularity: Breaks down code into smaller, manageable pieces.\n",
        "2 . Reusability: Code can be reused in multiple contexts.\n",
        "3 . Easier maintenance: Changes are more localized.\n",
        "4 . Improved scalability: New features can be added without affecting existing code.\n",
        "5 . Better organization: Code is more structured and organized.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "17.  What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  1. Class Variable:\n",
        "    - Shared by all instances of the class.\n",
        "    - Defined outside any method.\n",
        "    - Accessed using the class name or instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Instance Variable:\n",
        "    - Unique to each instance of the class.\n",
        "    - Defined inside a method (usually __init__).\n",
        "    - Accessed using the instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  Multiple inheritance is when a class inherits properties and methods from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  *__str__ and __repr__ Methods*\n",
        "1 . *__str__*: Returns a human-readable string representation of an object, used for display purposes.\n",
        "2 . *__repr__*: Returns a string that represents the object in a way that could be used to recreate it, often used for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "20.  What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  The super() function is used to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Access parent class methods: Call methods from a parent class.\n",
        "2. Override methods: Extend or modify parent class behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python>?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  The __del__ method is a special method in Python classes known as a destructor. It is called when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose\n",
        "1. Resource cleanup: Release resources, such as file handles or network connections, when an object is no longer needed.\n",
        "2. Memory management: Although Python's garbage collector handles memory management, __del__ can be used to perform additional cleanup tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "22.  What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  1. *@staticmethod*:\n",
        "    - Belongs to the class, not the instance.\n",
        "    - Doesn't have access to class or instance variables.\n",
        "    - Used for utility methods that don't depend on the class or instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2 . *@classmethod*:\n",
        "    - Belongs to the class, not the instance.\n",
        "    - Has access to class variables.\n",
        "    - Used for methods that need to work with the class itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Method overriding: Subclasses provide their own implementation of a method.\n",
        "\n",
        "2 . Common interface: Objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.  What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  The __call__ method lets you treat an object like a function, making it callable. This allows for more flexibility in coding patterns.\n",
